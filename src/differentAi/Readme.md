# Different AI Integration

## Overview

This directory contains implementations for various AI models that can be integrated with our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application. The goal is to provide a flexible framework that allows switching between different AI providers based on specific requirements, cost considerations, or performance needs.

## Available Integrations

Currently, the following AI model integrations are available:

### Gemini

Google's Gemini models offer strong performance for various natural language tasks. This integration supports:

- Text generation and completion
- RAG-based question answering
- Context-aware responses
- Streaming responses

Implementation details can be found in the `/gemini` directory.

### DeepSeek R1 Zero

DeepSeek's R1 Zero model provides an alternative AI implementation with distinctive capabilities for certain use cases. This integration includes:

- Efficient text generation
- Specialized knowledge capabilities
- Fine-tuning options
- Custom parameter configurations

Implementation details can be found in the `/deepSeekR1_Zero` directory.

## Common Interface

All AI implementations follow a standardized interface to ensure easy switching between providers:

```javascript
class AIProvider {
  async generateResponse(prompt, context, options) { /* ... */ }
  async embedText(text) { /* ... */ }
  // Additional methods as needed
}
```

## Configuration

Each AI provider requires specific configuration settings, typically including API keys and model parameters. Environment variables should be used for sensitive information:
